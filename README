//Because github seems to like readmes, a lot

That's an assignment for a CG course, I have to
render something using a depth buffer (without OpenGL), 
but I decided to push it a little further and
implement lots of stuff.

What do I have to do:
 - Render a cube, using a light source and materials
(really, it's that simple)

Yellow-brick road for that:
 - glutWrapper, so I can use the window and keyboard
and implement my own display and reshape (DONE)
 - Copy my vector library from the raytracing repo
 - Implement display lists and vertex functions, test
them by printing on the screen

(To be continued)
