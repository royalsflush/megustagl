//Because github seems to like readmes, a lot

That's an assignment for a CG course, I have to
render something using a depth buffer (without OpenGL), 
but I decided to push it a little further and
implement lots of stuff.

What do I have to do:
 - Render a cube, using a light source and materials
(really, it's that simple)

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!

So, MeGusta 2.0:
Rendering can be done with OpenGL like engine or
with raytracing. Besides, it includes clipping support
and treatment for those nasty assert cases

Yellow-brick road:
 - Enable functions to set/get render mode (DONE!)
 - Create raytracing class (DONE!)
 - Init raytracing with the engine (DONE!)
 - Set up camera in transform functions (DONE!) 
 - Triangle class (DONE!)
 - Create list of triangles for rendering (DONE!)
 - Set up the ray class (DONE!)
 - Modify render function so it works with
	raytracing (DONE!)
 - Test change of modes (DONE!)
 - Fix the raytracing function so it works with
	perspective
 - Implement antialiasing
 - Implement reflection (in material)
 - Implement refraction (in material)
 - Implement shadows
