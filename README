//Because github seems to like readmes, a lot

That's an assignment for a CG course, I have to
render something using a depth buffer (without OpenGL), 
but I decided to push it a little further and
implement lots of stuff.

What do I have to do:
 - Render a cube, using a light source and materials
(really, it's that simple)

Yellow-brick road for that:
- Projection transform
- Rasterization

What's ready:
- the wrapper to glut
- lighting!
- primitives: triangle and cube
- Inverse of the matrix

What would look great:
- vector template! \o/
- rotations, translations and scaling
- Put arcball code (aweeeesome!)

What's not tested:
- Lots of lights
