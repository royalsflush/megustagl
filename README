//Because github seems to like readmes, a lot

That's an assignment for a CG course, I have to
render something using a depth buffer (without OpenGL), 
but I decided to push it a little further and
implement lots of stuff.

What do I have to do:
 - Render a cube, using a light source and materials
(really, it's that simple)

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!
